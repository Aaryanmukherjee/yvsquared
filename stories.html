                <p>Voter Suppression is the systematic effort by politicians and certain interest groups to deliberately silence the votes of those who 1) oppose their views and 2) lack the ability to fight back.

                        <h2>Oppose Voter ID Legislation</h2>
                        <p>Currently, thirty-four states have implemented voter identification laws at poll booths; unfortunately, this policy serves the purpose of disproportionately harming low-income, racial and ethnic minorities, the elderly, and people with disabilities. There are several reasons for this such as the fact that many forms of government-issued photo identification cost anywhere from $75 to $175, which is far too much for many Americans, and the travel required to obtain this identification places a burden on many Americans who do not have the means to make this trip. Unfortunately, a 2014 GAO study found that strict photo ID laws reduce turnout by 2-3 percentage points, which can translate into tens of thousands of votes lost in a single state.

                        <h2>Voter ID Laws Really Do Discriminate</h2>
                        <p>Ever since the Supreme Court struck down a key portion of the Voting Rights Act in 2013, states such as Arizona, Rhode Island, Texas, Alabama and many more have implemented voter ID laws. Tragically, these policies have failed to provide a substantial benefit, only serving to marginalize certain demographics. As researchers at Harvard and Tufts University explain, the requirement of an obscure form of identification that many Americans do not have access to such as say, a Social Security number, is equally as accurate as having the person’s address, date of birth, gender, and name - information that is far more accessible for these Americans.

                        <p>From 2013 to present-day 21 million eligible voters in the United States are barred from voting in 34 different states due to unreasonable voter registration laws in place in those states. Although advocates claim that voter ID laws exist to counter voter fraud, during the time period of 2000 to 2014 - when there were little to no voter ID laws - only 31 out of 1 billion cases of voter fraud were detected. In reality, however, voter ID laws have prevented 18 percent of citizens over the age of 65, 16 percent of Latino voters, 25 percent of voting-age African Americans, and 15 percent of voting-age Americans who earn less than $35,000 from voting due to stringent voter ID laws with no clear benefit, but numerous drawbacks.

                        <h2>Indiana’s voter-ID law is harmful and worthless.</h2>
                        <p>In 2008, the Supreme Court heard a case regarding the constitutionality of the state of Indiana’s voter ID laws. Proponents explained that these laws are necessary in order to target one source of voter fraud - in-person impersonation fraud. Even more, there has not been one verified case of this type of voter fraud in the state of Indiana’s history. In the process of keeping people who are not eligible to vote from voting, voter ID laws have restrained people who should be able to vote from their Constitution guaranteed rights. To support this, studies have shown that nearly 10 percent of the voting population, or 20 million Americans, do not have a government-issued photo ID. Thus, voter ID laws that are being introduced in state governments are having more harms than benefits.

                        <p>Historically, voter ID laws have had a discrimination effect, as many citizens lack access to facilities where they can obtain such documentation. For example, Texas has some of the strictest voter ID laws to date, and in 81 of 254 of their counties, there are no locations where people can obtain the necessary ID to vote. It is well noted that in support of these laws, mainly Republicans and the Republican National Lawyers Association cite the 375 election fraud cases; however, when a study was conducted to investigate these cases, not a single one of these cases was because of voter impersonation fraud - the exact type of fraud that ID laws are aimed at decreasing

                        <p>For much of our country’s history, voting has been a right elusive to many: at the birth of America, only white, property-owning males could vote. Eventually, through the 15th and 19th Amendments in the Constitution that allowed African Americans and women to vote, voting rights were slowly expanded to more of the population. However, trends of the last decade have indicated that the US is reversing this progress, as new policies that are being passed in unprecedented numbers are openly discriminating against the elderly, disabled, minorities, and students. In fact, the Brennen Center for Justice at New York University concluded that in the 2012 Presidential election, as many as five million voting-eligible Americans had their right withheld from them by these laws. Even on a small scale, preventing people from voting affects regional and judge elections, thus muffling the voices of millions and stagnating progress at every level in America.

                        <p>Over growing debate surrounding the issue of voter ID laws, more and more studies are being conducted to assess whether there exists a racial disadvantage hidden within these laws. A new study by Zoltan Hajnal, Nazita Lajevardi, and Lindsay Nielson at the University of California San Diego attempts to clarify this issue by analyzing the specific effects of voter ID laws. Unfortunately, the conclusion is that there is a clear and definite racial impact: when comparing states with and without voter ID laws, the gap between white and Latino voters doubles in states with such laws. Such laws are allowing some candidates to win when they shouldn’t, thus changing the policies being passed in local, regional, and state governments, harming many lives every day.

                        <p>Ever since the first Anti-Voter ID law was passed, politicians in favor have cited increasing voter fraud as the reason why these policies are so necessary. But, a study out of Loyola Law School in Los Angeles has concluded that from 2000-2014, there were only 31 confirmed cases of voter fraud out of an astonishing 1,000,000,000 votes; in other words, only .000000031 percent of votes in major elections are compromised due to voter fraud. So, in essence, anti-voter ID laws are trying to solve a problem that is minor and simply too minute to demand so much of our attention. Instead, some argue that anti-voter ID laws are creating more of a problem than the one they were designed to fix.

                        </h2>
                        <p>In 2017 alone, 29 states have passed over 85 bills designed to restrict access to voting and registration as part of a sweeping trend all over the U.S. One state in particular where such laws have had a devastating impact is in Wisconsin, as 300,000 voters in this state alone have been prevented from voting. Even more, many of these laws have targeted African Americans and Latinos as African-American voters in Wisconsin were 1.7 times as likely as white voters to lack a driver’s license or state photo ID and Latino voters were 2.6 times as likely as white voters to lack proper ID. Problematically, in the most recent presidential election in 2016, the Republican candidate Donald Trump won the state by a slim margin of 22,000 votes. This leads one to wonder if the results would have been different if these discriminatory laws were not in place, demonstrating the impact that these laws have had on the nation, as they have even swayed outcomes on the national level in major ways.
